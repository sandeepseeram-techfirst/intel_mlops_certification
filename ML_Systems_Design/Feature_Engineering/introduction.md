#### Feature Engineering 

Note: Many features can be automatically learned and extracted by algorithms.

##### Handling Missing Values 

1. Missing not at random (MNAR)
2. Missing at random (MAR) 
3. Missing completely at random (MCAR)


 InterpretML is a great open source package that leverages feature importance to help you understand how your model makes predictions.
