#### Machine Learning Systems

##### Important Points: 

1. the algorithm is only a small part of an ML system in production.


#### What is MLOps? 

To operationalize something means to bring it into production, which includes deploying, monitoring, and maintaining it. MLOps is a set of tools and best practices for bringing ML into production.


Machine learning is an approach to (1) learn (2) complex patterns from (3) existing data and use these patterns to make (4) predictions on (5) unseen data.


#### Zero-Shot Learning 

In the zero-shot learning (sometimes known as zero-data learning) context, itâ€™s possible for an ML system to make good predictions for a task without having been trained on data for that task.
