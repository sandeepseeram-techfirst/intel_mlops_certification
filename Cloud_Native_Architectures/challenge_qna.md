#### Challenge Questions:

1. What are the benefits of creating architecture diagrams for software systems?
2. How can architecture diagrams aid in communicating with non-technical stakeholders?
3. What design principles should be considered while creating architecture diagrams?
4. Describe a scenario where modifying one component in the architecture might impact other components.


#### Challenge Question Answers:

1. Architecture diagrams visually represent the system's design, making understanding complex structures and relationships easier. They facilitate effective communication among team members, stakeholders, and developers. Diagrams can also serve as documentation, aiding in maintenance and troubleshooting.

2. Architecture diagrams use visual elements that are easier for non-technical stakeholders to comprehend than technical documentation. They allow stakeholders to grasp the system's overall design, potential risks, and impacts on business objectives. 
3. When creating architecture diagrams, consider principles like modularity, loose coupling, and high cohesion. Strive for simplicity, avoiding unnecessary complexities. Additionally, ensure consistency with the actual implementation of the system.

4. For example, if a new feature is added to a component, it might require changes to the APIs exposed by that component. These changes can affect other components that rely on those APIs, leading to a ripple effect of modifications across the architecture.
