#### Model Observability and Triggering  

- Data Drift vs. Concept Drift 


##### Metrics 
- Prediction Accuracy 
- Error Rates 

- Logging 

#### Drift 

- Drift involves changes in data distribution (data drift) or relationships between variables (concept drift) 
- Data drift can make predictions inaccurate and can result from various factors. 
- Concept drift is challenging to detect and might need technique like regular retraining.
