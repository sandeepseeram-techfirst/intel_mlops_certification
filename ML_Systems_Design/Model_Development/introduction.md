#### Model Development 

Different aspects of model development, such as debugging, experiment tracking and versioning, distributed training, and AutoML. 

Model development is an iterative process.

##### Evaluation Techniques 
1. perturbation tests 
2. invariance tests
3. model calibration 
4. slide-based evaluation.

###### AutoML?  
AutoML - using ML to automatically choose a model best for your problem.


##### Learning Curves 
A simple way to estimate how your model’s performance might change with more data is to use learning curves. A learning curve of a model is a plot of its performance—e.g., training loss, training accuracy, validation accuracy—against the number of training samples it uses
