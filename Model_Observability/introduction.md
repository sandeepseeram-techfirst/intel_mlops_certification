#### Model Observability and Triggering  

- Data Drift vs. Concept Drift 


##### Metrics 
- Prediction Accuracy 
- Error Rates 

- Logging 

#### Drift 

- Drift involves changes in data distribution (data drift) or relationships between variables (concept drift) 
- Data drift can make predictions inaccurate and can result from various factors. 
- Concept drift is challenging to detect and might need technique like regular retraining. 


#### Triggering 

- Triggers activate processes when model performance degrades. 
- Set triggers based on predefined thresholds, eg. accuracy dropping below 85% 
- Triggers, Monitoring and Logging together ensure high service quality in models. 


####### Denial of Service (DOS) concerns 

#### Techniques

- A/B testing 
- Canary Releases
