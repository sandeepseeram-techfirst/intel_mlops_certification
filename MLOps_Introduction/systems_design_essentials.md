# ML Pipeline 

### Data Processing 
Preparing and transforming raw data for machine learning. 

### Model Development 
Using processed datasets to train a machine learning model. 

### Inference 
Using trained models to make predictions or generate assets. 


#### Data Processing 
- Collection 
- Cleaning and Preprocessing 
- Feature Engineering 
  creating new features or transforming existing features to capture relevant patterns and relationships within the data. 

###### Tools for Data Processing 
    - Apache Spark 
    - Pandas 
    - Apache Kafka 

#### Model Development 

- Algorithm Selection - Selecting a suitable model architecture or algorithm that aligns with the problem at hand. Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks. 
- Training 
- Validation 
- Refinement 

##### Common Technologies

- PyTorch 
- Tensorflow 
- Scikit Learn 


#### Inference 
using trained models to make predictions or generate assets 
Two Types: 
 - Realtime 
 - Batch 

##### Monitoring Model Inference 
- Reliability Score 
- Satisfaction Score 
- Model Performance 
- Accuracy 
- Distributions 
- Latency 
- Denial of Service
