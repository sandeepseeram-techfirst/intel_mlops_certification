#### Model Training 

##### Sampling 
Sampling is an integral part of the ML workflow. 

Sampling happens in many steps of an ML project lifecycle, such as sampling from all possible real-world data to create training data; sampling from a given dataset to create splits for training, validation, and testing; or sampling from all possible events that happen within your ML system for monitoring purposes. 

##### Data Lineage 
Itâ€™s good practice to keep track of the origin of each of your data samples as well as its labels, a technique known as data lineage. 

Data lineage helps you both flag potential biases in your data and debug your models.
