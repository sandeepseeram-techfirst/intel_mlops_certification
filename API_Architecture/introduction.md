#### Application Programming Interfaces 

An API acts as an interface or contract specifying how different software components interact. 
API's define the methods, protocols, and data formats components that can be used to communicate and exchange information. 

- Data pipelines 
- Machine Learning Models 
- Inference Engines - use API's to communicate and share data. 

#### API Architectures 

- Pipeline 
- Event 
- Layered 

#### REST API Architecture 

RESTful APIs or Representational State Transfer APIs, are an architectural style for designing networked applications. 
They follow a set of contraints, which when  as a whole, allows a system to be highly scalable, stateless, and maintainable, with components that can be managed and updated independently.
