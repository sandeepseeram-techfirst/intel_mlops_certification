#### Classification
- The algorithm will answer binary yes-or-no questions (fraud or not, is it an apple, will the customer churn) or make a multiclass classification (type of tree, and so on). You also need enough labeled data for the algorithm to learn from.

#### Regression 
- The algorithm predicts continuous numeric values based on various independent variables. For example, regression algorithms can aid in estimating the right price for a stock, the expected lifetime of a component, temperature, and so on.
