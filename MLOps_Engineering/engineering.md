#### ML models
clustering, logistic regression, decision trees, collaborative filtering, and various neural network architectures including feed-forward, recurrent, convolutional, and transformer

#### ML techniques 
such as supervised versus unsupervised, gradient descent, objective/loss function, regularization, generalization, and hyperparameter tuning

### Metrics 
such as accuracy, F1, precision, recall, ROC, mean squared error, and log-likelihood

### Statistical concepts
such as variance, probability, and normal/long-tail distribution

Common ML tasks such as language modeling, anomaly detection, object classification, and machine translation
