- Feature Stores 

- Data Versioning - to ensure reproducibility and traceability in ML Projects. 

#### Real-time Data Pipelines 

- Vital for ingesting, processing and transforming data in real-time. 
- Supported by tools like Apache Kafka, Apache Flink and Amazon Kinesis 
- Enable real-time analytics and immediate model feedback. 

#### Data Lakes and Warehouses 
- Central Storage for both structured and unstructured data. 
- Supported by Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Amazon S3 and Google BigQuery. 

#### Data Versioning 
- Ensures reproducibility and traceability in ML projects. 
- Tools like DVC, Git LFS extend traditional version controls for data.
