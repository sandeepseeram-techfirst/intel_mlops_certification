#### Model Training 

##### Sampling 
Sampling is an integral part of the ML workflow. 

Sampling happens in many steps of an ML project lifecycle, such as sampling from all possible real-world data to create training data; sampling from a given dataset to create splits for training, validation, and testing; or sampling from all possible events that happen within your ML system for monitoring purposes.
