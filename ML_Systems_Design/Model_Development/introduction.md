#### Model Development 

Different aspects of model development, such as debugging, experiment tracking and versioning, distributed training, and AutoML. 

Model development is an iterative process.

##### Evaluation Techniques 
1. perturbation tests 
2. invariance tests
3. model calibration
4. slide-based evaluation.

###### AutoML? 
AutoMLâ€”using ML to automatically choose a model best for your problem.
