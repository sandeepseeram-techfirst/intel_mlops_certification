#### Data Engineering 

If data models describe the data in the real world, databases specify how the data should be stored on machines. 

two major types of processing: 
###### Transactional 
###### Analytical

#### Data Sources 
An ML system can work with data from many different sources. 


###### Note: 
Debugging ML systems is hard, it’s a common practice to log everything you can!!! 
This means that your volume of logs can grow very, very quickly. 

###### Log Analysis Tools
Splunk, Elasticsearch - Logstash, Datadog, Logz.io, etc

also note, Even though this is system-generated data, it’s still considered part of user data and might be subject to privacy regulations. 

#### First-party data
is the data that your company already collects about your users or customers. 

#### Second-party data  
is the data collected by another company on their own customers that they make available to you, though you’ll probably have to pay for it. 

#### Third-party data
companies collect data on the public who aren’t their direct customers.



#### Smart Phone Data - Now, its a opted service on most smartphones. 
Each phone used to have a unique advertiser ID. iPhones with Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) and Android phones with their Android Advertising ID (AAID)—which acted as a unique ID to aggregate all activities on a phone. 


#### Data Formats 

How do I store multimodal data, e.g., a sample that might contain both images and texts?
