#### AI Solution Architectures 

- Code Reusability 
- Maintainability 
- Extensibility 


#### Design 1 - Pipeline Solution Architecture 
provides a structured composition of sequential or parallel processing steps for tasks like data preprocessing, model training and inference stages. 

##### Stages: 
Data Processing =============> Model Development ==============> Inference Service 

#### Design 2 - Model Serving Architecture 
- The Model-Serving solution architecture centers on deploying and utilizing trained models in production environments, enabling their accessibility for making predictions or providing insights. 

- The architecture involves designing a system capable of handling incoming requests, preprocessing input data, applying it to the trained model, and returning predictions or results to the requester. 

- Leverages technologies and frameworks like TorchServe, Tensorflow Serving, OpenVINO Model Server, MLflow Models, ONNX. 

#### Design 3 - Event-Driven Architecture 

- Event driven architecture in AI solution emphasizes real-time data preprocessing and inferencem where specific actions or processes are triggered by events or data streams, enabling immediate decision making and responsiveness. 

- Use Cases: 
  - Anomaly Detection 
  - Fraud Detection 
  - Real-Time Recommendation Systems 

#### Stream Processing Frameworks 

- Apache Kafka 
- Apache Flink 

#### Federated Learning Architecture 

- Enables collabrative model training across multiple devices, organiations, ensuring data privacy and reducing data transfer. 
- The aggregated gradients from these local models are shared to improve the global model, avoiding the need for raw data transfer. 
- Federated Learning is beneficial when data privacy is a concern or data transfer is resource-intensive.
