#### Data Engineering 

If data models describe the data in the real world, databases specify how the data should be stored on machines. 

two major types of processing: 
###### Transactional 
###### Analytical

#### Data Sources 
An ML system can work with data from many different sources. 


###### Note: 
Debugging ML systems is hard, it’s a common practice to log everything you can!!! 
This means that your volume of logs can grow very, very quickly. 

###### Log Analysis Tools 
Splunk, Elasticsearch - Logstash, Datadog, Logz.io, etc

also note, Even though this is system-generated data, it’s still considered part of user data and might be subject to privacy regulations. 


#### First-party data 
is the data that your company already collects about your users or customers. 

#### Second-party data  
is the data collected by another company on their own customers that they make available to you, though you’ll probably have to pay for it. 

#### Third-party data  
companies collect data on the public who aren’t their direct customers.
