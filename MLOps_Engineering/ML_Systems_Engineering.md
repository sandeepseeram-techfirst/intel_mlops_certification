#### Machine Learning Systems

##### Important Points: 

1. the algorithm is only a small part of an ML system in production.


#### What is MLOps? 

To operationalize something means to bring it into production, which includes deploying, monitoring, and maintaining it. MLOps is a set of tools and best practices for bringing ML into production.

Machine learning is an approach to (1) learn (2) complex patterns from (3) existing data and use these patterns to make (4) predictions on (5) unseen data. 


#### Zero-Shot Learning

In the zero-shot learning (sometimes known as zero-data learning) context, it’s possible for an ML system to make good predictions for a task without having been trained on data for that task.


#### The cost of wrong predictions is cheap

Unless your ML model’s performance is 100% all the time, which is highly unlikely for any meaningful tasks, your model is going to make mistakes. ML is especially suitable when the cost of a wrong prediction is low. 

##### For example: 

one of the biggest use cases of ML today is in recommender systems because with recommender systems, a bad recommendation is usually forgiving—the user just won’t click on the recommendation.

#### Fraud detection 
is among the oldest applications of ML in the enterprise world. 
If your product or service involves transactions of any value, it’ll be susceptible to fraud. 

#### Churn prediction 
entails forecasting the moment when a particular customer or employee is likely to discontinue their usage of your products or services, allowing you to implement suitable strategies to retain them. This predictive analysis is not limited to customers but extends to employees as well.
