#### Microservices Architecture 
a collection of small independent services. self contained units - communication with other services via API, HTTP or Message Queues. 

- Enables horizontal scalability 
- Independent Deployment 

##### Challenges 
- Ensure reliable inter-service communication and maintaining data consistency. 
- Implement robust fault tolerance mechanisms and handling communication failures. 
- service discovery, monitoring, logging mechanisms, and latency considerations. 

#### Design Patterns

- Service Autonomy 
- Bounded Contexts 
- Decentralized Governance 

#### Service Discovery 
- Service Discovery Patterns facilitate dynamic service registeration and discovery, allowing services to find and connect without hardcoded dependencies.
