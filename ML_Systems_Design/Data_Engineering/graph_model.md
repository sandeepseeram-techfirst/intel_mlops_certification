#### What is Graph Model? 

The graph model is built around the concept of a “graph.” A graph consists of nodes and edges, where the edges represent the relationships between the nodes.

A database that uses graph structures to store its data is called a graph database.

Because the relationships are modeled explicitly in graph models, it’s faster to retrieve data based on relationships.
